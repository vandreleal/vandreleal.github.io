It also provides an easy to use interface to manage jobs, trigger remote executions, and view logs from remotely executed jobs. You can also quickly get a new device started since all configuration files and logs are stored in the cloud and synced after sign in.</p>\n<p>The desktop distribution includes both the daemon and a full-featured GUI, whereas the ARM distribution includes only the daemon, and is recommended for resource-constrained devices like the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org\">Raspberry Pi</a>. We only collect basic user information during registration (such as your name, email address, and social media avatar), and we do not share your personal data with any affiliates or service providers.</p>\n<h3>Devices</h3>\n<p>You can view all connected devices including some basic information such as the percentage of CPU and memory used by the device, virtual memory available, and uptime since session establishment.</p>\n<h3>Jobs</h3>\n<p>Creating a new job is quick and easy. Fill out the form and save to get the new job listed and available on all your connected devices. You also have the option to view, create, and edit jobs directly in the job editor. We use the <a href=\"https://yaml.org\">YAML</a> data-serialization language to configure jobs in Runlet. The list of all supported attributes can be found on the <a href=\"https://runlet.app/docs/job/definition\">docs</a> page. The resulting log and status of each execution are shown in real-time on any connected device. <em>Wait, is that secure?</em> Yes, all logs are encrypted by the host machine before submission and decrypted once received by another connected device.</p>\n<h2>Download</h2>\n<p>All available distributions and versions can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/releases\">releases</a>.</p>\n<h2>Contributing</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of ways in which you can contribute to the app, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues\">Submit bugs and feature requests</a></li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://runlet.app/docs\">documentation</a> and make pull requests for anything from typos to new content suggestion</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Feedback</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask a question on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/runlet\">Stack Overflow</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues\">Report an issue</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"CONTRIBUTING.md\">Request a new feature</a></li>\n<li>Up vote <a href=\"https://github.com/runletapp/runlet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc\">popular feature requests</a></li>\n<li>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/runletapp\">@runletapp</a> and let us know what you think!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>License</h2>\n<p>Copyright (c) Runlet.
